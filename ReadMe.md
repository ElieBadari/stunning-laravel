Here i will be writing my findings and answers to the questions of the project.
question1 : what is sudo and why is it used?
'sudo' is short for 'superuser do' and is used to run commands as the superuse/root user. This means the commands are run by a user that has unrestricted access to all files and directories. A superuser can perform any actions that are possible on the system.
sudo is used to elevate privaleges which is beneficial because things like installing software or modifying system files require elevated privaleges. 
question2 : what is apt-get and why is it used?
'apt-get' is cli utility used to manage pacakges. Its uses are, but not limited to, installing, removing and upgrading software pacakges.
'apt-get' and 'sudo' work well together since 'apt-get' usually requires superuser privaleges to run.
